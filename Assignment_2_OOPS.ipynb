    "# 3) Encapsulation:\n",
    "    # ADTs often use encapsulation to bundle data and operations together. \n",
    "    # The internal details are hidden from the user, and access to the data is controlled through well-defined interfaces.\n",
    "    # In Python, classes are commonly used to implement ADTs. The methods of the class define the operations of the ADT, and the attributes represent the data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "# Examples of ADTs:\n",

    "# >>Composition enhances code maintainability and modularity in Python programs by promoting the creation of smaller, more focused, and reusable components that can be easily understood and modified. \n",
    "\n",
    "# >>Here are some key ways in which composition contributes to code maintainability and modularity:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1.Separation of Concerns:\n",
    "#     >>Composition allows you to break down complex systems into smaller, more manageable components.\n",
    "#     >>Each component is responsible for a specific functionality or aspect of the system, promoting a separation of concerns. \n",
    "#     >>This separation makes it easier to understand, modify, and maintain individual pieces of code without affecting the entire system.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2.Code Reusability:\n",
    "    # >>By creating small, independent components, you increase the likelihood of code reuse. Components can be used in different contexts or projects, reducing the need to duplicate code.\n",
    "    # >>This not only saves development time but also ensures consistency across different parts of the codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3.Flexibility and Adaptability:\n",
    "    # >>Composition allows you to change and extend the behavior of a system by adding or modifying individual components.\n",
    "    # >> This makes the codebase more flexible and adaptable to changes in requirements. You can update or replace specific components without affecting the entire system, making it easier to evolve the software over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4.Encapsulation:\n",
    "    #>>Composition facilitates encapsulation, as each component can hide its internal implementation details and provide a well-defined interface. \n",
    "    #>>This reduces the likelihood of unintended side effects when modifying one part of the code, as the internal workings of a component are hidden from the rest of the system.\n",
    "    \n",
    "# 5.Ease of Testing:\n",
    "    #>> Smaller, modular components are generally easier to test in isolation.\n",
    "    #>> Unit testing becomes more straightforward, as you can focus on testing the functionality of individual components without having to navigate complex, intertwined code. \n",
    "    # >>This leads to more reliable and maintainable test suites.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6.Enhanced Readability:\n",
    "    # Code readability is improved when you use composition to build a clear hierarchy of components. \n",
